AI-Driven Patient Follow-up and Prediction System for Telemedicine
Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-driven telemedicine support system that enhances patient care through automated follow-ups and predictive health analysis.

The system analyzes medical conversations and patient data to predict health outcomes, identify patients who require follow-ups, and automatically schedule reminders. This significantly reduces the manual workload for healthcare professionals and improves overall patient engagement.

The project demonstrates the practical application of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and backend system integration in real-world healthcare environments.

Problem Statement

In modern telemedicine platforms:

Doctors often struggle to manually track patient follow-ups

Important health indicators may be missed

Manual monitoring increases workload and inefficiency

There is a need for an intelligent system that can:

Analyze patient conversations

Predict potential health risks

Automate follow-up scheduling

Solution

This project provides:

Automated patient follow-up predictions using machine learning models

NLP-based medical text analysis for extracting meaningful insights

Integration with scheduling systems such as Cal.com

A scalable and modular backend architecture

Key Features

Predicts patient follow-up needs using machine learning models

Analyzes medical conversations using natural language processing

Automatically schedules reminders and follow-ups

Improves efficiency of telemedicine workflows

Designed for scalability and reusability
